TaxpayerSys V 1.0

This system can be run on a local machine but also be formally hosted online via hosting platforms. 
The system is OS platform independent i.e. it can run on Android, Windows, Linux, Mac OS e.t.c. 
provided the platform has a web browser installed

To be able to run the system locally you will need:
1. A Localhosting service e.g. Apache that comes together with the Xamp, Lamp, Wamp, or Mamp softwares. 
2. Web browser
3. Working internet connectivity (for the system to be able to consume the web service)

STEPS
1. Install the web hosting software
2. Check via the local hosting software that the Apache service is running
3. Extract the system files directly to the htdocs or www folder depending on the software.
5. Rename the folder to TaxpayerSys
4. Open the browser and type "Localhost/TaxpayerSys" then press enter to begin to use the system

NOTE: All this will only be possible when there is a working internet connectivity
